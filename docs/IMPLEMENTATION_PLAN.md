## 📋 Risk Management

### High-Risk Features

#### OCR Integration (F014)
**Risk**: API costs and accuracy concerns
**Mitigation**: 
- Implement Tesseract.js fallback
- Set usage limits and monitoring
- Extensive testing with real handwriting samples

#### Data Synchronization (F012)
**Risk**: Complex conflict resolution, data loss
**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Add data integrity checks
- Create manual conflict resolution UI
- Implement audit logging

#### Mobile App Store Approval
**Risk**: Rejection or delays in app store review
**Mitigation**:
- Follow platform guidelines strictly
- Submit early beta versions
- Have expedited review contacts
- Plan buffer time for resubmissions

### Dependency Risks

#### Supabase Service
**Risk**: Service downtime or limitations
**Mitigation**:
- Monitor service status
- Have migration plan to self-hosted
- Implement graceful degradation
- Regular data backups

#### Third-Party APIs
**Risk**: Rate limits, cost overruns, service changes
**Mitigation**:
- Implement caching strategies
- Set up usage monitoring and alerts
- Have fallback options for each API
- Budget for API costs with buffer

## 🎯 Questions for Clarification

Before proceeding with implementation, please clarify:

1. **Budget Constraints**: What's the budget for third-party services (OpenAI, Google Vision, etc.)?

2. **Target Markets**: Are we focusing on specific geographic regions initially?

3. **Regulatory Requirements**: Any specific healthcare data compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR)?

4. **User Testing**: Do you have access to beta testers (parents with babies)?

5. **Team Size**: How many developers will be working on this project?

6. **Timeline Flexibility**: Are the 16-week timeline and milestones flexible?

7. **Revenue Model**: Is this a free app, freemium, or subscription-based?

8. **Device Support**: What's the minimum iOS/Android version to support?

9. **Offline Requirements**: How long should the app work offline (days, weeks)?

10. **Data Export**: Any specific requirements for healthcare data sharing?
